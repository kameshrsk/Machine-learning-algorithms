# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects section of my repository! This collection features projects that showcase my journey and expertise in NLP techniques and methodologies.

## Projects

### Stock Price Fluctuation Prediction

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Description: In this project, I employed various NLP techniques, including Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec, to predict stock price fluctuations based on textual data. Additionally, I utilized TensorFlow to explore neural network-based approaches for stock price prediction.

### Fake News Detection with LSTM

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras

Description: In this project, I delved into Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to detect fake news articles. Leveraging deep learning and sequential analysis, I built a model capable of identifying deceptive information from authentic news articles.

## Usage

Each project directory contains detailed explanations, code implementations, and insights gained from the NLP analysis.

Enjoy exploring the world of Natural Language Processing and its diverse applications!
