# Movie Recommender System Project

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System Project section of my Machine Learning repository! This section showcases a project focused on creating a personalized movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've delved into the realm of recommendation systems to develop a model that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and behaviors. By employing collaborative filtering, I aimed to provide users with tailored movie suggestions that align with their viewing history.

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Filtering:** I've utilized collaborative filtering techniques, including both item-based and user-based approaches, to generate accurate and relevant movie recommendations.

- **User Preferences:** The project involves analyzing user behaviors, such as movie ratings and viewing history, to identify patterns and recommend movies that align with individual tastes.
