# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning projects repository! This collection features a variety of projects where I've delved into diverse datasets, implemented cutting-edge algorithms, and constructed predictive models. Each project is thoughtfully organized within its dedicated directory, complete with a comprehensive breakdown of the problem, approach, and code implementation.

## Projects

### House Rent Prediction

Description: In this project, I utilized Linear Regression to forecast house rent prices based on a range of features such as location, number of bedrooms, and amenities.

### Student Admission Prediction

Description: Employing Logistic Regression, this project focuses on predicting the likelihood of student admission by analyzing exam marks and various contributing factors.

### Handwritten Digits Recognition

Description: Leveraging a Neural Network architecture, I created a robust model capable of achieving high accuracy in the classification of handwritten digits.

### Cat and Dog Classification with XGBoost

Description: This project delves into the realm of Decision Trees, utilizing XGBoost to classify images of cats and dogs with remarkable precision.

### Mall Customer Segmentation

Description: Through the application of K-Means Clustering, this project seeks to categorize mall customers based on their behaviors, employing algorithms that iteratively enhance accuracy by minimizing a custom-defined cost function.

### Anomaly Detection in Data Center

Description: Utilizing unsupervised learning techniques, I've developed a system that assesses the normal behavior of computers in a data center. This anomaly detection project employs key features like throughput and latency to flag deviations from the established baseline.

### Movie Recommendation System

Description: In this collaborative filtering endeavor, I've built a movie recommendation system that employs both item-based and user-based approaches. By analyzing user behaviors and preferences, this system provides tailored movie suggestions.

### Stock Price Fluctuation Prediction

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Description: Predicting stock price fluctuations using NLP techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec. Experimented with TensorFlow for deep learning-based predictions.

### Fake News Detection with LSTM

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras
Description: Implemented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to identify fake news articles, applying sequential analysis for accurate detection.
