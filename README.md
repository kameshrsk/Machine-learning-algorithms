# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of my Machine Learning projects, where I explore various datasets, implement algorithms, and build predictive models. Each project is organized in its respective directory with a detailed explanation of the problem, approach, and code implementation.

## Projects

1. **House Rent Prediction**
   - Description: Implemented Linear Regression to predict house rent based on features like location, number of bedrooms, and amenities.

2. **Student Admission Prediction**
   - Description: Used Logistic Regression to predict the probability of students getting admission based on exam marks and other factors.

3. **Handwritten Digits Recognition**
   - Description: Built a Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits achieving high accuracy in digit classification.
