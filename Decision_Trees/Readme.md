# Decision Tree Classification Project

Welcome to the Decision Tree Classification Project section of my Machine Learning repository! This section showcases a project centered around the implementation and utilization of Decision Trees, with a focus on classifying images of cats and dogs using the XGBoost algorithm.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've explored the power of Decision Trees and XGBoost in classifying images. By utilizing features extracted from images of cats and dogs, I aimed to develop a robust model that can accurately distinguish between these two classes.

## Key Features

- **XGBoost Algorithm:** I've employed the XGBoost algorithm, a powerful and efficient implementation of gradient boosting, to build a high-performing classification model.

- **Image Features:** The project involves extracting meaningful features from images of cats and dogs, transforming visual data into information that the model can learn from.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains detailed explanations, code implementations, and insights gained from the classification task. Feel free to delve into the code and methodology to understand how Decision Trees and XGBoost contribute to accurate image classification.
