# Unsupervised Learning Projects

Welcome to the Unsupervised Learning Projects section of my Machine Learning repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that delve into the fascinating world of unsupervised learning techniques. Each project explores different aspects of data analysis, clustering, and anomaly detection.

## Projects

### Mall Customer Segmentation

In this project, I've applied the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their behavior and spending patterns. By iteratively refining the algorithm with a custom-defined cost function, I aimed to achieve more accurate and meaningful customer clusters.

### Anomaly Detection in Data Center

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in data center computers' behavior. I've employed unsupervised learning methods to assess the normal operation of computers using features such as throughput and latency. Any deviations from the established baseline are flagged as anomalies.

### Movie Recommendation System

Here, I've tackled the challenge of building a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. By implementing both item-based and user-based approaches, the system suggests personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors.

## Usage

Each project directory contains detailed explanations, code implementations, and insights gained from the analysis. Feel free to explore the code, methodology, and results of each project.

Happy exploring and learning in the realm of unsupervised learning!
